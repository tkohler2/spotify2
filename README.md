EC601-Spotify 2 android app final version

In order to run the app, you would need to download and install the 

Android Studio and open the project. Click the "open an existing project"

and go to wherever you put the project.

Recommend to run the app on an Android device rather than the emulator. 

For the app's recognition function, make sure to face the camera towards a

relatively dark background to increase the detection accuracy.

The app can detect any 1-finger gesture(Stone), 3/4-finger gesture(ok), and 5 finger gesture

(paper), make fun with that!
